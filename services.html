                   <code>The Companies Bill, 2012, passed by the Lok Sabha a few months ago, has recognised the importance of diversity in the board room. Certain class of companies will soon be required to have at least one woman director on board. The EU has long recognised the value that women directors bring to the table. 

But, policies need to be reworked even at the ground level. With the budget around the corner, the time is just right for some rethinking which will boost empowerment of women at the workplace, or provide for greater women security. 

Higher tax exemption limits: The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, guarantees equal pay for equal work, but ground realities are a bit different. A survey by the World Economic Forum in 2009 not only pointed out wage gaps between men and women, but also showed that most women employees were present only at the entry and middle levels of management. It was difficult for them to break the glass ceiling. For this year, India's rank was a poor 127 out of 134 countries in relation to the Economic Participation and Opportunity Gender Gap Sub-index. Three years later in 2012, there hasn't been much improvement, with India's ranking standing at 123 out of 135 countries, in respect of this particular parameter. </code>
